# Why this project?
 Welcome to Kare for Kritters, your go-to Pet Adoption Website, dedicated to facilitating the journey of connecting loving homes with deserving animals. 
 Pet adoption and fostering is something that has always held a special place in my heart so creating a mock adoption website truly felt like a passion project.
